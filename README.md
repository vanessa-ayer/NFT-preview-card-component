## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Code snippets I'm most proud of are displayed below:

```html
<div class="img-top">
  <img src="/images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="NFT Artwork" />
  <div class="img-cover">
    <img src="/images/icon-view.png" alt="" />
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.img-cover {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.3);
  display: none;
}
```

```

```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on advanced CSS - including Flexbox and CSS Grid. There is so much to learn and I want to continue focusing on all CSS capabilities and design.
